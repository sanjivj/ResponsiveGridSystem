A Meteor wrapper for Graham Miller's [Responsive Grid System](http://www.responsivegridsystem.com/). 

What is the Responsive Grid System?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Responsive Grid System is a small but powerful css grid and starter css file. 
RGS is not a full-fledged front-end framework like Bootstrap or Foundation, but 
it can be the best tool when all you need is a simple and flexible grid system.

Why a meteor package?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Responsive Grid System can be awkward to add to a meteor app; get the link 
address, decide where to put it, download and unzip.. This wrapper allows you to 
add it to your Meteor app in one easy step:
